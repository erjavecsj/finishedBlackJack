=================

1. Once the player runs out of money the program stops functioning correctly and screws everything else up.
2. The single best feature is how the computer creates the cards and their values and this is different as it is extremely condensed and is easy to follow.
3. Classes in java help to deal with complicated code because they seperate everything apart so that you can work on a specific part of your program instead of having all of it in one class.
4. Private can only be used in that one class where is it created and helps so it doesn't get accessed in other unwanted places while public allows things to be called from anywhere.
5. Instances are a relationship and are in a class and can be changed whereas a class is the overall place where everyting is held for that one object.
6. An inheritance is when classes branch off of another main class and this allows for the lower classes to pull things from the main class and this makes it easier when you have similar classes.
7. This references the variable inside the class you are using and super calls the parent constructor.
8. The two properties of an object are state and behavior.
9. Calling on other objects is still confusing along with the inheritance but now i feel better about getters and setters.
